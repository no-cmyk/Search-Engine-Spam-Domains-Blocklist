# Search Engine Spam Blocklist
A regularly maintained blocklist to filter out spam domains from search engines' results.


## What's this about?
You know all those weird autogenerated spammy sites that always pop up in search results, with such amazing titles as "FREE prize sex hot stud bangs busty Finnish Healthcare Clinics for sale"?
This list aims to collect as many of them as possible by searching for specific word combinations found almost solely in spam domains.
It's mainly thought as a tool for search results filtering extensions such as Google Hit Hider and uBlacklist.

## Notes
- Because of the sheer size of this list, it may take a while to load and serve its function depending on the inner workings of the extension it's used with.
For this reason a lighter version of the list is available here: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Blocklist/master/blocklist_light.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Blocklist/master/blocklist_light.txt).
This lighter version does not contain sites registered under the .tk, .gq, .ga, .ml and .cf top-level domains.
- Despite my best efforts to keep it updated and tidy, this list may contain false positives. If you notice one, please let me know by opening a new issue.

## Instructions
1. Go to [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Blocklist/master/blocklist.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Domains-Blocklist/master/blocklist.txt) (or [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Blocklist/master/blocklist_light.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Domains-Blocklist/master/blocklist_light.txt) if you prefer the light version).
2. Copy and paste the list into your favourite search result filtering extension.
